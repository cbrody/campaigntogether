              <p>We bring together people from the UK, no matter what their background, to stop the Tories from winning another parliamentary majority at the next election. We use electoral data to determine which left-leaning party has the best chance of beating the Tories in 50 of the most marginal seats and support any and all volunteers to get out campaigning.</p>
              <p>We started out as a group of volunteers in the 2017 General Election who were terrified of a Conservative landslide. We knew that the single most effective way to change elections is simple: ordinary people canvassing others in their community through door knocking, phone calls and texts. So we trained thousands of volunteers to go out door knocking, run events and make phone calls to make sure that progressives win.</p>
              <p class="strong">And we did it! We helped “swing the vote” in 25 constituencies across the country.</p>

            <p>When voter turnout is low, the Tories win – but if it increases, even by as little as 5%, they would lose by a landslide. The Tories know this and it terrifies them – they want to keep young and working-class people off the voter register. By joining the UK’s biggest voter registration campaign you can get people in your community registered to vote.</p>

            <p>We know the areas where campaigning will have the biggest impact in getting rid of the Tories. We’ll support volunteers to pool their efforts to campaign for the progressive candidate who’s most likely to win in these areas. Anyone can campaign with Campaign Together; whether you’re a veteran canvasser of first time door-knocker, we’ll make sure you have the support and network you need.</p>
