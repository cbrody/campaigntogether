# campaigntogether
Code for www.campaigntogether.org

To use this with squarespace (you will need correct credentials):
```$ git remote add squarespace https://squarespaceURL/template.git```

So you should have:

```$ git remote -v
  origin	https://github.com/cbrody/campaigntogether.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/cbrody/campaigntogether.git (push)
  squarespace	https://squarespaceURL/template.git (fetch)
  squarespace	https://squarespaceURL/template.git (push)```

Until such time as continuous integration is implemented please make sure to push your changes to both remotes. 
In case of conflict/doubt the GitHub repo is the canonical source.
